# VoteReach
This is a simple website designed to that encourages people to register for voting by turning it into a competitive game. 
Each player that signs up on our site gets their own online vote registration link to share with friends. (Optionally the link can be sent to the player's email.) Everytime a friend uses their link, that player gets a point on the website.
A leaderboard of all users is displayed on our homepage.

The site we redirect our users to: https://www.usa.gov/register-to-vote

Entry file for the server is `./main.py`
JS and CSS files go in `./static'`
HTML files go in `./templates`
Leaderboard data is stored in text file called `userdata.txt` We only store a username and number of clicks to function.
